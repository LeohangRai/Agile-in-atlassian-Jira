Lean is about creating value and eliminating waste in order ot reduce costs and improve efficiency, productivity
and quality.
In a nutshell, lean is about a way of looking at how we do things and removing as much waste as possible such 
that the end customer gets the most value.

A lean culture empowers employees and focuses on customers
- eliminate waste 
- reduce costs
- improve efficiency
- improve productivity
- improve quality

Removing waste doesn't necessarily mean just throwing things away.
We can take resources that aren't adding value in one place and use them somewhere else where they do.


NOTE:
Lean is about incremental improvement.
In other words, improve 30% now instead of 100% later or never.
By the time we perfectly plan a 100% improvement, we'll have lost valuable time and the business  environment
will have changed.

How Lean works
removing waste so the end customer gets the most value

waste - parts of the process that don't add value for the customer (Theses are the steps we're trying to elimiate with Lean)
customer - 
value - 


Why Principles?
the principles are more important than the practices or tools.
Principles tend to be foundational and long lived even as the practices and tools change. 

"With a better tool, we can get wonderful results. But if we use it incorrectly, the tool can make things worse.
We should not forget to always use the principles."
- Taiichi Ohno

Taiichi Ohno discusses the importance of understanding the principles in his Toyota Production Systems book. 
Here is the list of Lean Principles:  (derived from the book) (it is subjective and different people may come up with
different lists)

#Lean Principles:
1. Empower the team
2. Visualize work
3. Experiment using the scientific method
    - Contnuously learn and improve

4. Improve the flow of value
    - improve the whole system
    - map the value stream
    - limit work in progress
    - pull work
    - eliminate waste
    - reduce setup times
    - automate what should be automated
