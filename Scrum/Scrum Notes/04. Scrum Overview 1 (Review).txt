- Scrum is an Agile framework.

- An increment is a potentially shippable portion of the project that meets the definition of done.

- A sprint is a time boxed period in which the increment is created.

- Scrum artifacts provide project transparency, enable shared understanding, and enable inspection and 
adaptation.

- Artifacts include: the product backlog, the sprint backlog, the sprint goal, sprint boards, and reports.

-Velocity is the rate at which the team accomplishes work, usually in story points per sprint.
