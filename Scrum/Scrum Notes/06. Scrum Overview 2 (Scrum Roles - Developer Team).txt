The development team is a cross-functional, adaptive team that does the work of the project. 

Responsibilities:
 - estimating issues (usually done using story points)
 - deciding how much work can be done in a sprint (only the development team can decide how much work to take out.)
 - deciding how to organize to do the work of the sprint
 - creating the increment of each sprint
 - ability to modify the sprint backlog during the sprint 

Imp Note:
The development team are the only members allowed to modify the sprint backlog during the sprint

#Number of members in the development team:
The Scrum Guide recommends having from 3 to 9 members of the development team.

Why 3 to 9? (2 pizza teams)
 - Fewer than three members decreases the productivity and quality created by a cross-functional group of people 
working together.
 - More than nine members tends to increase the amount of coordination required.

Jeff Bezos at Amazon refers to two pizza teams,
meaning two pizzas should be able to feed the entire team.
To scale scrum to more than nine people, it is usually better to create multiple teams.
