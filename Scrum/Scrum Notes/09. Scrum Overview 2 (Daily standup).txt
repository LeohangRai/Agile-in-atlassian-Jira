2. Daily Standup / Daily Scrum
It is a planning meeting that occurs everyday and the participants usually stand as a reminder that 
it's a short meeting. 

 - Attendees: development team (primarily) (others are usually asked to listen only)
 - Duration: 15 mins or less usually
 - Purpose:
    inspect recent progress toward the sprint goal
    plan the day's work
    Identify any impediments (hinderances) and find plans to solve them

 - Output: plan for the day


It's important that the daily standup is a collaborative meeting and not simply a status update.
The team collaborates to make the best decisions for the day given the latest information.
They usually decide on who will work on specific issues, to plan slightly changes after every daily standup.
This is continuous improvement.
