Scrum events are also referred to as ceremonies of meetings.

A sprint contains 4 types of events:
1. Sprint planning meeting
2. Daily standups
3. Sprint review
4. Sprint retrospective


#Characteristics of all Scrum Meetings 
All of the scrum meetings have some common characteristics which are as follows:

1. fixed maxm time limit, no minimum time limit

2. meetings are primarily to plan, inspect and adapt 
(In agile projects, the planning is distributed throughout the project rather than the mostly upfront planning of 
waterfall projects)

3. primarily about collaborating, not updating status
(The work is visualized so you don't need a meeting to see the status. )

4. primarily spend time on things that are of value to all the participants (rather than only a group)
(If the discussion moves in a direction that becomes a value to only a portion of the participants,
it should be moved to a later time outside of the meeting.)
