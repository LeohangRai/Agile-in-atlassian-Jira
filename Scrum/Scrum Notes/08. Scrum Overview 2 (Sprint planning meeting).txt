1. Sprint Planning meeting
The sprint planning meeting is held at the start of a sprint.

- Attendees: entire scrum team
- Duration: typically 4 hours for a 2 week sprint (twice for 4 week long sprint)
- Purpose: plan the work of the sprint
- Output: Sprint goal, sprint backlog

NOTE: (What goes in and what comes out)
proposed sprint goal + proposed issues ----> Sprint planning meeting -----> Sprint goal + Sprint backlog

#Not very necessary to read: (Just an extension of the points noted above)
Before the meeting, the product owner usually has a proposed sprint goal and a minimum set of issues that accomplish 
the goal.
These preliminary items often come from the product backlog that has been updated during the previous sprints,
sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings.

During the meeting, the team usually discusses the sprint goal, modifies the sprint backlog,
places story point estimates on issues, and adds details to the issues to better describe the specific work to be done.

The development team is responsible for estimating the story points for the work and deciding on how much work can be 
done during the sprint.
They need to do enough planning to have an accurate forecast for the amount of work that they will agree to.

The development team also creates subtasks for the first few days of the sprint.
The subtasks are often a day or less of work.

This is an example of an empowered team rather than a command and control based team.
The purpose of the meeting has been met when there is an agreed upon sprint goal and sprint backlog.
The sprint backlog contains the issues that the development team has agreed to complete during the sprint,
as well as a plan for completing that work.
