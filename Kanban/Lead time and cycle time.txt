Lead time and cycle time are two terms related to processes.

The lead time is the time from tissue creation to completion.
In this workflow, the lead time is the time from when an issue is created to the time that it is done.
If a customer is waiting for an issue to be complete, they care about the lead time.

Cycle time is the time from starting work on an issue to its completion.
In this workflow, the cycle time is the time that the issue is in the 'in progress' status.
The team mostly is concerned with improving cycle time.

The work in progress limits that we discussed earlier help to reduce cycle time.
