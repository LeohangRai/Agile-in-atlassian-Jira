Like all boards, the Kanban board is a tool used to visualize the workflow of a team.
Here are the columns of the default Kanban board in Jira.
You can see that there are four columns.
When issues are created,
they're automatically appear in the backlog column.
The issues in the backlog might need
a bit more discussion or planning before they are ready to be worked on.
When an issue is ready to be worked on,
it is pushed to the ''Selected for Development'' column.
This can be thought of as the team's prioritized to-do list.
When someone from the team is ready to work on an issue,
that person pulls the top issue from the ''Selected for
Development Column'' into the ''In Progress'' column.
When the work of the issue is done,
it is pushed into the ''Done'' column.
You can see that Kanban boards are
a simple and effective way to visually manage the team's work.
Even though we are showing the default Kanban board,
the column configuration can be customized to match the way that your team works.
Kanban boards focus on improving the flow of issues through the workflow.
New issues are continuously added to the backlog and are always being prioritized,
usually by the business team.
Once the issues are ready to be worked on,
they are pushed to this ''Selected for Development'' column,
and then flow through the statuses of the workflow.
Work is continuously being finished before starting new work.
When a team member is ready to work on a new issue,
they simply choose the top issue under ''Selected for Development''.
This ensures that the team is always working on
the most important issue as defined by the team.
