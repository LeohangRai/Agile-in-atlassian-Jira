A cycle time control chart is used to show the cycle time for issues over time.
A circle is placed on the chart when an issue is moved to the 'done' column,
the elapsed time is the time that the issue spent in the 'in progress' status.
As mentioned earlier, this is the cycle time for the issue.
You can click on an issue to see the issues details.
The solid blue line shows the rolling average cycle time.
In general, you would like to see the team improve the cycle time as is done here.
Trending down means that issues are completed faster as time progresses.
The red line indicates the average cycle time for the period of the chart.
The shaded band indicates the standard deviation of the cycle time over time.
That band becomes more narrow if all of
the issues are completed with about the same cycle time.
Process improvements can narrow this band
increasing the predictability of the team and improving estimates.
